PiFi is a file storage and transfer server setup to be used with RaspberryPiâ€™s to 
create cheap ($35+Price of a Storage Unit) file storage.

As it is PiFi aims to support the following:
	User Accounts : Let multiple people use the server and keep everything 
		partitioned
	Fully Encrypted : Keep all user data safe end-to-end and in storage
	
currently only being built to support a single pi attached to some sort of disk
but may include other more secure setups in the future.
